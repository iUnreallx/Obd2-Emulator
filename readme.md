# ELM327 Emulator

> **ELM327 Emulator** is a lightweight open-source desktop tool for simulating ELM327 / OBD2 adapter responses without real vehicle hardware.

It allows developers to test OBD2 dashboards, diagnostic tools, and serial communication logic in a controlled virtual environment.

## About The Project

**ELM327 Emulator** was created to simplify development and testing of OBD2-based applications.

Instead of connecting to a real car and physical ELM327 adapter every time, the emulator provides predictable diagnostic responses through a serial interface.

The project is useful for:

- testing OBD2 dashboards;
- debugging ELM327 command handling;
- simulating vehicle telemetry;
- developing without real hardware;
- learning how ELM327 / OBD2 communication works.

## Key Features

- **ELM327 Command Simulation**  
  Handles common ELM327 and OBD2 requests.

- **Live Vehicle Data Emulation**  
  Simulates RPM, speed, coolant temperature, and battery voltage.

- **Serial Port Communication**  
  Works through a COM / serial-port based transport layer.

- **Qt/QML Interface**  
  Provides a clean desktop UI for controlling simulated vehicle values.

- **Developer Friendly**  
  Designed for testing, debugging, and future protocol expansion.

## Built With

- **C++**
- **Qt 6**
- **QML**
- **Qt SerialPort**
- **CMake**

## Why ELM327 Emulator?

Testing OBD2 applications usually requires:

1. a car;
2. an ELM327 adapter;
3. a stable connection;
4. repeated manual testing.

This emulator removes that dependency.

It gives developers a simple virtual environment where they can test how their application reacts to diagnostic commands and changing vehicle data.

## Installation and Setup

To build the project, you need:

- Qt 6.5 or newer;
- CMake 3.16 or newer;
- a C++ compiler;
- Qt SerialPort module.

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/iUnreallx/ELM327-Emulator.git
```

### 2. Open the project

```sh
cd ELM327-Emulator
```

### 3. Build with CMake

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

### 4. Run the application

```sh
./build/appObd2-Emulator
```

```

## How It Works

The emulator receives ELM327 / OBD2 commands through a serial connection and returns simulated responses.

Basic flow:

```sh
OBD2 App
   ↓
Serial Port
   ↓
ELM327 Emulator
   ↓
Simulated OBD2 Response
```

Example commands:

```sh
010C    # Engine RPM
010D    # Vehicle speed
0105    # Coolant temperature
ATRV    # Battery voltage
ATZ     # Reset
```

## Roadmap

- Separate ELM327 protocol logic from serial transport;
- Add transport-independent emulator core;
- Improve command parser with buffered input support;
- Add ELM327 session state;
- Add response formatter;
- Add PID handler registry;
- Add golden tests for stable protocol behavior.
